# heart-disease-prediction
Machine Learning model to predict heart disease risk using Logistic Regression

This project predicts the risk of heart disease using a Logistic Regression model trained on a tabular patient dataset.

## Steps:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Train-test split
- Logistic Regression model training
- Model evaluation using accuracy score

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook (`heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`) in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Run the cells step by step to see preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
